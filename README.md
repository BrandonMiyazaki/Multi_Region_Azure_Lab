Learning Objectives 
In this project, you will get the opportunity to deploy a highly available multi-tire web application across multiple Azure regions. In this lab you will gain experience with the following services:
	• Deploying source code using GitHub actions and VSCode
	• Creating Azure App Services and a .NET application
	• Creating Azure SQL Databases and configuring Failover Groups
	• Deploying Azure Front Door and configuring multi-geo redundancy
	• Use application insights to track application activity



Prerequisites: 
 
	• Your laptop: Win, MacOS or Linux OR A development machine that you have administrator rights. 
	• VS Code locally installed with .NET SDK and Git packages 
	• Active Azure Subscription (Microsoft non-production sub or Personal tenant). Owner rights needed at subscription level. 
	• A personal GitHub Account. Sign up here if you do not already have one: https://github.com/join



Architecture: 

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to deploy a data-driven ASP.NET Core app to Azure App Service and connect to an Azure SQL Database. This lab will utilize a geo redundant architecture that leverage Azure Front Door and the concept of a primary and failover region based on the following design:
